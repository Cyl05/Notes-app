# Notes App

Notes app made using PERN stack (Postgres Express React Node) with basic features
I made this to figure out how to link a react front end to express server and database.

Features include viewing notes, creating notes, editing notes and deleting notes.
Uses axios for communication with back-end and MUI for front end components

To use:
- run `npm i` in both folders
- `node index.js` in server
- `npm run dev` in client
- the website will be live at http://localhost:5173
